## Project 1: Garden Path Sentences

This project explores the intriguing world of garden path sentences. Garden path sentences are linguistic constructions that lead to temporary confusion or ambiguity, requiring reevaluation to arrive at the intended meaning.

Unravel the secrets of garden path sentences and their impact on language comprehension. Discover the challenges they pose for both humans and computational systems, and gain insights into the complexities of natural language processing.

## Project 2: Semantic Similarity

The Semantic Similarity project aims to explore the field of natural language processing (NLP) and its application in determining the semantic similarity between different texts. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques and algorithms, we provide a powerful tool that can analyse and measure the similarity of textual data. Whether it's for information retrieval, content recommendation, text classification, or other NLP tasks, this project enhances the understanding and comparison of texts, enabling more efficient and effective data analysis.

## Project 3.1: NLP Application Categorization

In the NLP Application Categorization project, we delve into the various applications of NLP in real-world scenarios. By categorising different use cases, such as email folder allocation, essay grading, and doctor-assisted diagnosis, we highlight the diverse ways in which NLP can be leveraged to enhance productivity, decision-making, and overall user experience.

This project serves as a guide to understanding the practical implementations of NLP and its impact on different industries and domains.

## Project 3.2: NLP and Google Search

The NLP and Google Search project explore the pivotal role that Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays in making Google Search the world's leading search engine. With a focus on understanding how NLP techniques improve web content understanding, enhance search results, enable features like customer support, sentiment analysis, and content recommendation, and tackle linguistic complexities, this project sheds light on the underlying mechanisms that power Google's search capabilities.

Uncover the synergy between NLP and Google Search, showcasing the transformative potential of NLP in revolutionising information retrieval and user experience.

*Through these projects, we invite you to delve into the fascinating world of NLP, explore its applications, and appreciate its significant impact on various aspects of our digital lives.*
